# Oauth2Rails

A gem that currently provides support for the Fitbit API using Oauth2 protocol.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'oauth2_fitbit_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install oauth2_rails

## Contributing
One project I would be very interested in is extracting this to a more general framework, that works with most clients on rails. For example, I'm sure the Fitbit flow is a little different, so it would not work always with other providers.

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/oauth2_fitbit_rails/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
